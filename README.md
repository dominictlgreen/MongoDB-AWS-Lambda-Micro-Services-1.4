# MongoDB-AWS-Lambda-Micro-Services-1.4
This repository demonstrates the core principles and practical implementation of modern cloud-native architectures using MongoDB, AWS Lambda, and microservices. It showcases how to build dynamic, scalable, and event-driven data pipelines, focusing on real-time data ingestion, processing, and storage.

## Prototye FAST & Build In-Full Reliably

Modern day architechtures if leveraged well can do incredible things.. what AWS has done is a vastly powerful and useful toolset.  
Particularly things like AWS Lambda & DynamoDB (or mongo db) for connecting and testing ideas, pipelines or actual production build(s).

For example it enables you to do things like connect to an AI api and reference stored documents on your companies pricing and terms of service..  
It can then be connected to your email server and answer your customers emails to a degree of similarity or above to most customer service agents.  
What's really incredible is the pricing and security that comes out of the box.. this is just one of many examples of the new age microservice thinking.  

however this does not really full showcase the power in utility of these tools, but it sets the stage for what they can be used for quickly / in summary.

Key features include:

## •	Serverless Architecture: 
Leveraging AWS Lambda for cost-effective, scalable event processing.

## •	Database Flexibility: 
Integrating MongoDB for high-performance document-based data storage and retrieval.

## •	Event-Driven Design: 
Implementing microservices and decoupled architecture to handle asynchronous workloads, scaling as demand fluctuates.

## •	Real-World Scenarios: 
Examples of handling API triggers, event streams, and background tasks, emphasizing data resilience and fault tolerance.

## •	Best Practices: 
Focusing on data consistency, error handling, and security for production-ready microservices environments.
